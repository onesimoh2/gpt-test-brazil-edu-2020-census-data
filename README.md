The data from Brazil education census is contained in a excel file containing multiples books. Each one of them presents multiple problems because the data as it is was prepare for presentation purposes. First it contains multiples hierarchical levels that must be flattened. Second  it contains one column (the first one) in which the hierarchy is expressed indenting each row with multiples spaces, and this need to be flattened too but, since python donâ€™t seams to provide this feature a function had to be developed for this purpose. The third problem is that this data is not a document nor a data table, even when flattened it is not entirely good to be treated as as SQL table nor a document. Nevertheless I decided to use embeddings to try to find which rows are more relevant to fulfil a given query. The example here is for only one book but it could be generalize to treat them all.
